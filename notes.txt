Additional stylesheets, bootstrap, font awesome, etc, should go into angular.json
It seems that static CSS and JS files can go in here
Look for the section:

"styles": [
    "src/styles.css"
],

src/app/app.module.ts is the entry point, components are added in there

the components folder was created by
"ng generate component components/Todos"

-----

In the main index.html in the root directory there is a special tag:

<app-root>

This refers to the xxx.component.ts which has a selector named 'app-root'.
Think of it as like a partial CSHTML or RenderBody of CSHTML. You can only put one in it seems.

Each TS file is like the razor page C# code
Each HTMl file is like the razor page CSHTML code, and must be wrapped in one <div>

I don't get it, I just don't.
This component here, there, service here and there. Strange syntax. This is confusing.
