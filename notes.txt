Additional stylesheets, bootstrap, font awesome, etc, should go into angular.json
It seems that static CSS and JS files can go in here
Look for the section:

"styles": [
    "src/styles.css"
],

src/app/app.module.ts is the entry point, components are added in there

the components folder was created by
"ng generate component components/Todos"
